## 📘 Abstract

In today's fast-paced digital world, many individuals struggle with managing their finances due to the limitations of traditional budgeting tools and manual tracking. Our project — **AI-Powered Personal Finance Tracker** — presents an intelligent, accessible, and bank-independent solution for effortless financial management.

This platform uses cutting-edge technologies like **Tesseract OCR** for extracting transaction data from receipts, **FinBERT NLP** for intelligent expense categorization, and supports **voice-based transaction logging** via the **Web Speech API** and **Stanza**. For smarter budgeting and forecasting, it integrates **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM models**.

Key modules include **Group Expense Management** for shared finances, and **Celery-based Reminders** to notify users about bills. The system is built with a **Django backend** and a responsive **HTML + Tailwind CSS** frontend.
